# React Memory Card Game

This project is a simple yet fun memory card game completed as part of the react section on the Odin Project.

## Game Description

The user is provided with a grid of 15 logos of world-renowned car manufacturers and the aim is to correctly try and select each logo exactly once, earning 1 point for each correct selection.  
After each click however, the grid order randomises so the user must remember all their previous choices to avoid selecting a logo they have already previously chosen.

If a logo is chosen twice, the players score is reset to 0 and the game will continue until the user is able to achieve a score of 15 points (correctly selecting all 15 logos exactly once in a row).

## Project Aims

The aim of this project was to apply the knowledge learned from the react section of the Odin Project relating to state, props and hooks.  
The hooks used in the project were:

- useState
- useEffect
